# K-Medoids Clustering

Created by: Daniel Song, Timothy Wong, and Harry Hao

Adapted from [Capital One's GAM GitHub](https://github.com/capitalone/global-attribution-mapping)

### All of our written code can be found inside gam_package

data: Contains datasets used for testing and development purposes

distance_functions: Contains three distance functions

medoids_algorithms: Contains all of the new scalable clustering algorithms 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k_medoids is the original clustering algorithm provided by capital one

plot_functions: Contains different plotting methods that help visualize and analyze the data

preprocessor: Contains a preprocessor file designed to help process the datasets before calling the clustering algorithms on them

unit_tests: Contains unit tests for each dataset

gam.py: Main GAM file that is used throughout the code base
